# eat'n'watch
## üçø For when you're ready to eat but don't know what to watch!

Welcome to **eat'n'watch**, my first (written on my own) app! I had the idea for it because I'm one of those people who got their warm plate in front of them but simply can't decide what to watch on DVD/on Netflix/wherever (so many options!) - and then, either the food is cold or I end up watching something for the millionth time... (nothing wrong with your comfort movies and series, though!)
<br/>
### How it works
The basic idea is: you enter your food category (cause Spaghetti Bolognese are pretty fine but also hard to connect with movies - so you'll want to choose "Italian") and **eat'n'watch** will give you three random suggestions that should match your food.
<br/>
At the moment, all you need to do first, is add your own collection, be it DVDs or your Netflix Watchlist, whatever you'd like to watch while munching will be good!
